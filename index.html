        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 1626, Beverly boasts a deep historical heritage. During the
          American Revolution, it played a pivotal role as the launching point
          for the first naval fleet of the United States. Its legacy is
          preserved in historic landmarks, such as the Balch House, one of the
          oldest wood-frame houses in America, and the Cabot Street Cinema
          Theatre, the oldest operating community theatre in the country.
